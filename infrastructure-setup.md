# Infrastructure Setup
Based on the syllabus provided, Parrot OS is used as the attacker machine, and VMWare Workstation is used. However, since I already have Kali Linux and Virtualbox, I will not be switching to Parrot OS in VMWare Workstation


## Setup Virtual Environment

## Download ISOs
- [Kali Linux](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2024.3/kali-linux-2024.3-virtualbox-amd64.7z)
- [Windows 10 Evaluation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/evalcenter/download-windows-10-enterprise)
- [Metasploitable Machine](https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip/download)

## Configuring Lab Networks
- All the VMs are set to Bridged Adapter mode, instead of NAT mode


## Setting Up Attacker Machine - Kali Linux VM


## Setting Up Vulnerable Machine - Metasploitable VM


## Setting Up Windows Machine - Windows VM


## Network Connectivity Across Lab Machines
- For all 3 of the VMs, ping the other 2 VMs to ensure network connectivity
