# Introduction To Cybersecurity

## Cybersecurity Nomenclature
- Reconnaissance : Attackers research and identify valuable information about their target through openly available information
- Initial Access (intrusion into network) : Getting initial foothold into the target devices (can be Server, computer, mobile device, cloud platform 
etc)
- Backdooring : Attackers installs malicious software's for future and continued exploitation
- Elevating privileges : They escalate to users possessing highest power in the environment so that they can control all the devices. 
- Data Exfiltration : Attackers collect and gather critical information from the target network
- Covering Tracks & maintaining persistence 
- APT : Also called advanced persistent threats or threat groups are sponsored (financially & intuitively) by nation state governments, powerful agencies etc. 
- Vulnerability : Mis-configuration or outdated versions in any software, application (web or mobile), Operating System, hardware etc.
- Payload : Generally controls the resource as crafted by attacker
- Exploit: Attackers leverages (abuse) such vulnerabilities to get control of the resource
- Cyber Warfare : Attacking a nation, causing comparable harm to actual warfare for strategic or military purposes
- Fileless Attacks : Attacks that do not involve files and is often stealth comparatively
- Social Engineering : Manipulating a person which results in performing actions or divulging confidential information
- Cyber Kill Chain : Kill chain depicts the full-fledge compromise cycle used by the threat groups (i.e reconnaissance to data exfiltration).
- Unauthorized access : Any access that violates the stated security policy.
- Espionage : The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating or receiving TOP SECRET information with an intent to the advantage of any foreign nation
