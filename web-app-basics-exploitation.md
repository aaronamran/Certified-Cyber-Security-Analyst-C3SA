- Content Management Systems (CMS) offers a flexible, back-end interface for users to edit, modify, and publish content on a website. CMS are fully managed by frameworks
- Over a third of websites online are powered by four key platforms: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal and Magento
- CMS can be hacked due to the following reasons:
  - Outdated version
  - Inexperienced administrators
  - Wide permissions to normal users
  - Malicious plugins
  - Phishing attempts
  - Few are open source

#### Custom Code (Made from scratch)
- Developer implements the designs / workflow as per the requirement of the project
- Ease of fulfilling the updates as per the requirement, but small update needs to be fixed by a professional developer

#### Hacking websites made from scratch
- Overly mis-configured setup
- Bad business logic
- Vulnerable libraries in the languages
- Integration with multiple other frameworks / languages
- Chaining multiple vulnerabilities
- Other attack vectors

#### Mapping attack surface

- Attack surface analysis is the mapping of part of a web application that needs to be analysed and tested for security vulnerabilities
- Used by security researchers to understand the in-depth working of the web app
- The main aim is to identify the attack vectors that can be leveraged externally

#### Points worth the time investment
- Login/Logout Fields
- Admin Spaces
- Logic Workflow
- Files uploaded by users
- Extranet interfaces (if any)
- Communication with other applications / systems via interfaces
- Custom implemented protocols / APIs etc
- Critical libraries like : Authentication / Authorization / Session management etc

#### Validate the findings
- Enumeration is the key, take your time to analyse the application workflow
- Identify mis-configurations that are not baselining with the standards
- Identify the risk associated with the identified mis-configurations
- Perform Penetration Testing (discussion in the next section)
- Validate the findings
- Document & Report as required

#### Vulnerabilities
- Server-side Vulnerabilities
  - Command Injection
  - Directory Traversal
  - Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  - SQL Injection
  - File Upload
  - Information Disclosure
- Client-side Vulnerabilities
  - Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  - Clickjacking
  - Cross-side Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
